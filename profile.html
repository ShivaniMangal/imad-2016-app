                I'm an 18 year old, currently pursuing BE CSE (2nd Year) in Sathyabama University.
                I love learning new things and crave for hands on experience to understand bookish knowledge better
                IMAD has been an amazing journey that has helped me bridge the gap between classroom knowleded and real time experience
                I must admit, I'm a beginner in the world of web development and have lots more to learn, but this course gave me a much needed boost to launch myself into the realm of modern application development.
            
            My friends call me a geek - I was awarded the Remibai Jeppiar Scholarship For Academic Excellence in my 1st Semester
            
            I love writing poetry and stories. My works have been published in 15 e-anthologies in Amazon Kindle, through a US-based comany called "The Prose". You can check out my literary works here : <a href = "/prose">WriterAtHeart - My literary journey</a>
